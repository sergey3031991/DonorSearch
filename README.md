Model for cetrificate â„–45  classification and and flip the uploaded images

Research Purposes

It is necessary to develop a model that determines degrees images and flip the uploaded images.Source Dataset
Classification

There were several models, such as ResNet50 with similar results (accuracy about 0.95, ROC-AUC about 1.0).
